# Changelog

All notable changes to Rarog are documented in this file.

Rarog was released as Lynx through version `1.4.3`. The project was renamed
starting with version `2.0.0` to avoid confusion with an existing chess engine.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-19

Release focused on a repo-contained SPRT/SPSA testing harness and a long
sequence of individually SPRT-gated search-tuning and robustness fixes. The
single largest change is a Stockfish-style time-management rewrite that fixed
a movetime budget bug — by far the dominant contributor to the cumulative
strength gain. Several speculative search-feature ports were tried and
rejected by the harness; they are listed below for transparency, since they
cost real development time even though they did not ship.

### Added

- Added `SearchParams` for search constants and tune-mode UCI spin options
  behind `--features tune`, allowing weather-factory SPSA to perturb search
  parameters without exposing development options in production builds.
- Added default-equivalent 1024ths-of-a-ply LMR adjustment parameters
  (`LmrTtPvAdj`, `LmrExactBound`, `LmrShallowTt`, `LmrCutNode`, plus the LMR
  table formula coefficients) so LMR tuning can be done through UCI options
  without changing baseline behavior.
- Added per-move quiet futility pruning (separate from the existing static
  futility margin), SPSA-tuned and SPRT-confirmed.
- Added a clock-mode time-safety valve: an absolute `2*MoveOverhead` reserve
  that binds only in genuine time scrambles, leaving normal time allocation
  untouched.
- Added repo-local testing/tuning helpers under `tools/`, including fastchess
  SPRT, pext-PGO test builds, SPSA setup (weather-factory), local tool setup,
  opening book storage, test-engine storage, and weather-factory configs.
- Added an optional `target-cpu=native` build path (`cargo xtask build --arch native`)
  for local/own-match binaries that can use CPU-specific instructions beyond
  the portable `x86-64-v3`/`avx2`/`pext` release assets.

### Changed

- Rewrote time management in the style of Stockfish: clock-mode budgeting now
  ports SF's `timeman.cpp` structure (optimum/maximum from elapsed time,
  game-ply-aware scaling) and between-iteration stopping uses SF's
  falling-eval / best-move-instability / effort-factor heuristics. Fixed a
  movetime bug where a small budget (e.g. 100 ms/move) collapsed to depth 1
  because the overhead subtraction could reduce the budget to ~1 ms.
- Reworked quiescence search's TT-bound stand-pat handling.
- Baked in the accepted Phase 1 pruning/margin SPSA tune:
  `AspirationDelta=31`, `FutilityBase=86`, `FutilityImproving=49`,
  `RazoringCoeff=191`, `NullMoveDepthCoeff=15`,
  `NullMoveImprovingBonus=25`, `LmpBase=115`, `LmpImproving=57`,
  `QuietHistPruneCoeff=4419`, `SeePruningCoeff=81`, `SeePruningMax=811`,
  `SingularBetaMult=4`, and `LmpCountBase=2`.
- Baked in SPSA-tuned quiet futility margins (`FpBase=184`, `FpCoeff=117`)
  and a re-tuned LMR table after harness correction.
- Shrunk the `BadCapture` struct (16 → 3 bytes) and removed a per-call board
  clone from `gives_check`'s castling path (replaced with a direct rook-attack
  test), eliminating the one allocator touch on a search-reachable path.
- Removed the dead `do_shallower` LMR re-search arm: the move loop's
  `alpha >= best_score` invariant made its trigger condition provably
  unreachable, so it was a no-op that only cost a redundant guard check.
- Reduced repeated move-flag decoding in quiet/capture classification helpers.
- Reworked cached checker calculation to compute only opponent checking pieces
  instead of building a generic all-attacker set and masking it afterward.
- Split insufficient-material detection into faster early exits for positions
  with pawns or major pieces.
- Folded evaluation phase accumulation into the existing piece iteration,
  avoiding a redundant popcount pass over every piece bitboard.
- Deferred SEE classification for TT captures until it is actually needed for
  post-search capture-history bookkeeping.
- Made development/test helper paths repo-local (`tools/bin`, `tools/books`,
  `tools/test_engines`, `tools/weather-factory`) instead of relying on
  machine-global `D:\chess` helper paths.

### Fixed

- Fixed clock-mode time forfeits at fast time controls (28 forfeits in a
  ~2,200-game gauntlet, down to 0) via the new time-safety valve, without
  regressing normal-time allocation.

### Evaluated and rejected (for transparency, not shipped)

- ProbCut port from a search-efficiency rewrite branch: **−24.5 ± 8.5 Elo**,
  reverted to the original implementation.
- Persisting history tables across searches (dropping the per-search aging):
  **−12.4 ± 6.2 Elo**, reverted.
- A singular-extension double-extension budget cap: inconclusive (H0),
  reverted.
- An LMR "do-deeper" re-search margin (do-shallower proved structurally dead;
  do-deeper alone): **−1.4 ± 2.7 Elo**, reverted to the futility baseline.

### Internal (no behavior change)

- Began an eval-rewrite groundwork program (attack-map substrate, all tunable
  eval weights hoisted into a parameter struct) to prepare for a future
  data-fit tuning campaign. Bench-fingerprint-identical throughout; no effect
  on this release's playing strength.

### Verified

- Phase 1 Group B pruning/margin tune: SPSA ran 2271 iterations / 72672 games;
  SPRT accepted H1 after 19458 games with `nElo +6.17 ± 4.88`, LOS `99.34%`.
- Time-management rewrite: SPRT accepted H1 at `+81 Elo` (762 games,
  `st=0.1`); a separate non-regression SPRT confirmed no clock-mode
  regression.
- Quiescence TT-bound stand-pat refinement: accepted, `+6.5 Elo` (`st=0.1`).
- Per-move quiet futility pruning: SPRT accepted H1, `+7.98 ± 4.42 Elo`
  (nElo `+10.97`).
- Harness-corrected LMR retune (after unifying SPSA/SPRT at `tc=3+0.03`):
  SPRT accepted H1, `+4 Elo`.
- Phase 2.9-close batch non-regression SPRT (time-safety valve + robustness +
  micro-optimizations, cumulative): `15,976` games, `Elo +2.02 ± 3.62`,
  `nElo +3.01 ± 5.39`, LOS `86.3%`, LLR `2.39` (`81.2%` of the way to the H1
  bound and still trending up when accepted). Cross-harness time-loss check
  (fastchess PGN `[Termination "..."]` tags): zero time-forfeit terminations
  across all games.
- Verified `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test --lib`,
  `cargo test --test engine_coverage --test search_strength`,
  `cargo build --release --features tune`,
  `cargo test --release --test uci_process -- --test-threads=1`, and the full
  `cargo test --release` suite.
- Rebuilt Windows `pext` and `avx2` PGO release assets. Both produced the
  current `bench 13` fingerprint of `5,446,782` searched nodes and responded
  correctly to `uci`; production builds expose no tune-only options.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-06-01

Patch release focused on tournament stability after two Little Blitzer
illegal-move artifacts revealed a search panic instead of an actually illegal
reported move.

### Fixed

- Fixed a rare quiescence-search panic when a deep tactical/check sequence
  reached the final fixed search-stack slot. Quiescence now stops before
  touching out-of-range PV/history stacks and returns a static corrected
  evaluation at the maximum ply, matching the main search's maximum-ply
  behavior.

### Added

- Added a direct regression test for the quiescence maximum-ply guard.
- Added regression coverage for the two Little Blitzer artifact positions that
  verifies search returns legal root moves.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-01

Patch release focused on search improvements for higher playing strength.

### Added

- Added Internal Iterative Reduction (IIR) for PV nodes when the TT move is
  completely absent (previously IIR was restricted to non-PV nodes).
- Added negative history updates for good captures (SEE ≥ 0) that were searched
  before a beta cutoff, consistent with existing treatment of bad captures and
  quiet moves.
- Added correction history updates for beta-cutoff nodes (Lower bound) when the
  search score exceeds the static evaluation, and for fail-low nodes (Upper bound)
  when the search score falls below the static evaluation. Previously correction
  history was only updated on PV/Exact nodes.

### Changed

- Unified capture history bonus at beta cutoff to use `history_bonus(depth)`
  (same formula as quiet history) instead of the flat `depth * depth` previously
  used for captures.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Renamed the engine from Lynx to Rarog.
- Updated the UCI engine identity, Cargo package name, executable name, release
  asset names, repository metadata, documentation, tests, and build helpers for
  the Rarog name.
- Renamed the internal PEXT compile-time cfg from `lynx_pext` to
  `rarog_pext`.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-05-29

Patch release focused on a small retained search-strength update and release
build polish after the 1.4.2 asset changes.

### Changed

- Raised the ProbCut margin from `beta + 160` to `beta + 180`.
- Relaxed late-move pruning thresholds so deeper late quiets are pruned less
  aggressively.
- Changed capture move ordering to use full SEE values for profitable captures
  instead of only threshold SEE.
- Renamed PGO release assets to include a `-pgo` suffix before the executable
  extension so PGO and non-PGO builds can coexist in `target/dist`.
- Kept PGO training on the built-in `bench` workload after a Lynx-specific EPD
  training set tested slower than bench-only PGO on the final 1.4.3 code.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-29

Release focused on CPU-specific build assets, PGO release builds, and removing
the incomplete MultiPV analysis path while keeping the 1.4.1 single-PV
search/eval behavior intact.

### Changed

- Replaced GitHub AVX-512 release assets with BMI2/PEXT x86-64 assets.
- Switched release-asset construction to the cross-platform `cargo xtask build`
  helper for base x86-64, AVX2, PEXT, and ARM64 builds.
- Compacted PEXT slider metadata so PEXT builds no longer carry unused magic
  multiplier fields.

### Removed

- Removed UCI `MultiPV` support and the sequential MultiPV root-search path.

### Added

- Added a compile-time PEXT sliding-attack table path enabled with
  `--cfg lynx_pext` and BMI2 code generation.
- Added a runtime BMI2 check for PEXT builds so users get a clear error instead
  of an illegal-instruction crash on unsupported CPUs.
- Added optional PGO release builds through `cargo xtask build --arch <asset>
  --pgo`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-28

Patch release combining the unreleased 1.4.0 TT-move safety work with search
hotpath cleanup and a small move-ordering update for checking quiet moves.

### Fixed

- Fixed fast legal validation for recaptures that remove a checking piece, such
  as `...gxf6` after `Nxf6+`, by removing the captured attacker from virtual
  attack bitboards as well as from occupancy.

### Changed

- Replaced clone-and-make based legal validation for TT-shaped and raw UCI
  moves with direct occupancy-based king-safety validation. This preserves the
  strict pseudo-legal checks from 1.4.0 while avoiding a full board clone on TT
  hits.
- Batched Lazy SMP shared node accounting so threaded search no longer performs
  an aggregate atomic node increment on every searched node. Final threaded
  search results still report exact total nodes by summing each thread result.
- Skipped duplicate TT capture scoring in the staged move picker after the TT
  move has already been emitted first.
- Added a direct-check ordering bonus for quiet moves so checking quiets are
  considered earlier by the move picker without changing legality filtering.
- Expanded low-ply quiet history from four plies to eight plies for stronger
  early-root move-ordering feedback.

### Added

- Added a board benchmark workload for direct legal move validation so TT/UCI
  move-validation cost is visible in local profiling.
- Added regression coverage for pseudo-legal pinned moves that must still be
  rejected by the final legal validator.
- Added regression coverage verifying that quiet direct-check moves receive the
  intended move-ordering bonus.
- Added regression coverage for the expanded eight-ply low-ply history window,
  including the boundary where ply eight is no longer recorded.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-28 (not released separately; included in 1.4.1)

Unreleased minor-version work focused on Stockfish-style transposition-table
move safety and search move ordering. These changes are included in the 1.4.1
release.

### Fixed

- Hardened TT/hash move use so stored moves are validated and canonicalized for
  the current board before search, quiescence, PV construction, or ponder
  fallback can use them. This prevents stale, aliased, or concurrently observed
  TT moves from entering searched PVs.
- Fixed UCI PV safety around malformed TT moves by rejecting impossible piece
  movement, moves from the wrong side, friendly-occupied destinations, illegal
  king movement, and malformed special-move encodings before `make_move`.

### Changed

- Reworked the move picker to emit a validated TT move first, then skip the
  duplicate when generated legal captures, quiets, or bad captures are visited.
- Changed UCI move parsing to use the same direct legal-move validator as TT
  move validation, while preserving canonical internal flags for captures,
  castling, en passant, and promotions.
- Added TT-derived ponder fallback from the child position when the searched PV
  does not already contain a ponder move.

### Added

- Added board-level pseudo-legal and legal move validation APIs for raw UCI or
  TT-shaped moves.
- Added regression coverage for friendly-occupied king moves, impossible king
  movement, malformed tournament-derived TT moves, TT-first move picking,
  TT-derived ponder fallback, and UCI PV replay at `Threads=1` and `Threads=8`.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-05-28

Patch release focused on completing Stockfish-compatible UCI ponder behavior
and Lazy SMP threaded search semantics.

### Fixed

- Fixed `ponderhit` handling so converting a ponder search to a normal search
  preserves elapsed thinking time instead of restarting the search clock. This
  matches Stockfish-style behavior and prevents tournament GUIs from allowing a
  ponder hit to consume an extra full move budget.
- Fixed threaded search accounting so UCI `nodes`, `tbhits`, stop, quit, and
  ponderhit state are shared across the main and helper threads rather than
  being reported or limited from the main thread alone.

### Changed

- Enabled threaded search for node-limited and MultiPV searches, with helpers
  using the same root move set and aggregate stop condition as the main thread.
- Reworked parallel best-result selection to use weighted votes from helper
  searches, with decisive scores, PV availability, depth, score, and the main
  thread used as tie-breakers.

### Added

- Added interactive UCI process regression tests for completed `go ponder`
  searches waiting for `ponderhit` or `stop` before emitting `bestmove`.
- Added regression coverage verifying that `ponderhit` after an already-spent
  `movetime` returns `bestmove` promptly rather than restarting the timer.
- Added UCI process regression tests for threaded `go nodes`, threaded
  `go infinite` plus `stop`, and threaded `go ponder` plus `ponderhit`.
- Added engine-level coverage for threaded aggregate node limits and threaded
  MultiPV legal root results.
- Documented release-preparation checks for `1.3.4`, including the release
  test suite and a short cutechess regression against `v1.3.3` at one and
  eight search threads.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-28

Patch release focused on UCI tournament compatibility and release-process
coverage.

### Added

- Added UCI `go perft N` support so GUI and tournament tools can ask the engine
  to count legal leaf nodes from the current position without starting a normal
  search.
- Added the advertised UCI `Ponder` option. This lets frontends discover that
  Lynx supports ponder-mode command flow even though the option itself is only a
  protocol setting.
- Added process-level UCI regression tests that launch the built engine binary
  and verify option advertisement, diagnostics, `go perft`, uppercase move
  input, and critical invalid-position handling.

### Changed

- Changed invalid `position` failures to report a clear critical UCI error and
  exit instead of continuing from the previous board state.
- Changed unknown UCI commands and unknown options to print explicit diagnostic
  messages.
- Changed empty `go` commands to run as an unbounded search until a limit or
  control command stops the search, instead of using a hidden shallow default.
- Changed UCI coordinate move parsing to accept uppercase square text, while
  still normalizing internally to the canonical lowercase move form.
- Changed `setoption` handling to wait for any active search to finish before
  applying engine configuration.

### Fixed

- Fixed compatibility with tournament managers that emit the common
  non-standard fullmove number `0` by normalizing it to fullmove `1` during FEN
  parsing.
- Fixed root draw positions, including fifty-move claim and dead-material
  positions, so the engine still returns a legal move when legal moves exist.
  `bestmove 0000` is now reserved for positions with no legal moves.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added a true threshold `see_ge` implementation so search pruning and move
  ordering can test exchange safety without always computing full SEE.
- Added transposition-table prefetching before child probes in main search,
  quiescence search, null-move search, ProbCut, and MultiPV root searches.
- Added root-effort-aware soft time scaling so unstable or low-confidence root
  searches can spend more of the available soft budget.
- Added regression coverage for promotion SEE thresholds, staged bad-capture
  ordering, mixed valid/invalid `searchmoves`, and current-generation
  `hashfull` accounting.

### Changed

- Changed staged move picking to search good captures first, generate quiets
  lazily, and delay losing captures until after quiet moves.
- Changed tactical capture scoring and pruning to use threshold SEE in hot
  paths, reducing full-SEE work during search.
- Made late-move reductions cut-node aware and slightly more sensitive to
  losing captures and strong quiet history.
- Made quiescence pruning use dynamic threshold SEE and late losing-capture
  filtering.
- Changed `hashfull` reporting to count only entries from the current TT
  generation for both local and shared tables.

### Fixed

- Fixed SEE accounting for promotion captures by using the promoted piece as
  the next attacker in the exchange sequence.
- Fixed invalid `go searchmoves` input that matches no legal root move to fall
  back to the full legal root move list instead of returning a spurious draw.
- Fixed excluded-move searches so the excluded move is not counted as a legal
  searched move.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added stricter FEN validation for complete ranks, legal pawn ranks, one king
  per side, adjacent kings, side-not-to-move check legality, castling-right
  consistency, and valid move counters.
- Added canonical en passant hashing so EP squares are kept in the position key
  only when a legal en passant capture exists.
- Added continuation correction history to the handcrafted-evaluation
  correction path.
- Added UCI `go searchmoves` root filtering and `go mate` depth handling.
- Added regression coverage for invalid FEN rejection, canonical EP handling,
  rule-50-aware TT mate recovery, insufficient-material search draws,
  `searchmoves`, and `mate` parsing.

### Changed

- Made transposition-table mate score recovery aware of the current rule-50
  counter to avoid reusing forced-mate scores past the 50-move horizon.
- Changed more search cutoffs to preserve fail-soft scores in TT storage and
  return values.
- Added staged main-search move picking so captures can be searched before
  quiet moves are generated at non-root non-check nodes.
- Reworked soft/hard clock allocation with a move-count horizon, explicit
  `movestogo` support, increment handling, and move-overhead reserve.
- Extended quiescence search depth and avoided static-evaluation fallback while
  still in check.
- Made quiet halfmove-clock increments saturating for robustness on high-clock
  positions.

### Fixed

- Fixed search scoring for insufficient-material positions so dead draws return
  an immediate draw result instead of non-zero material/PST scores.
- Fixed a crash path where illegal FENs with the side not to move already in
  check could reach move generation.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Added incremental pawn, minor-piece, and color-specific non-pawn structure
  keys for more precise pawn keys and richer correction history indexing.
- Added low-ply quiet history and pawn-structure-indexed quiet history to
  improve move ordering in the main search.
- Added additional continuation-history channels at wider ply distances.
- Added high-depth null-move verification to reduce tactical risk from
  aggressive null-move cutoffs.
- Added capture futility pruning in quiescence search.
- Added fifty-move-rule dampening to the handcrafted evaluation.
- Added regression coverage for pawn-key color/structure collisions and
  evaluation scaling near a fifty-move-rule draw.

### Changed

- Reworked static-evaluation handling so transposition-table entries store raw
  static evals and apply the current correction history on probe.
- Improved pruning selectivity with TT-assisted pruning evals, improving-aware
  futility margins, and refined shallow razoring/null-move conditions.
- Improved tactical move ordering with SEE-aware capture scores and capture
  history while ordering losing captures behind quiet candidates.
- Improved root time usage by extending past the soft limit after material
  score drops and by stopping early in forced single-legal-move positions.
- Improved clock allocation for explicit `movestogo` and sudden-death controls
  with more conservative hard limits and increment handling.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-25

### Changed

- Made timed-search allocation more conservative at fast controls by assuming
  a slightly longer remaining game and lowering the hard-stop cap. This reduces
  avoidable time forfeits while leaving fixed-depth and fixed-movetime search
  behavior unchanged.

### Added

- Added time-manager regression coverage for fast sudden-death clocks,
  fixed `movetime`, side-to-move clock selection, explicit `movestogo`,
  minimum allocation, and unbounded fixed-depth searches.
- Added UCI option/parser regression coverage for default `go`, invalid search
  limit values, invalid `setoption` values, and preservation of previous
  engine option values after rejected input.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Added UCI `MultiPV` option and basic sequential MultiPV root analysis output.
- Added `tbhits` reporting in UCI search info.
- Added Syzygy tablebase load summaries that report WDL and DTZ file counts and
  the largest loaded tablebase cardinality.
- Added root Syzygy move ranking through Fathom's DTZ root API, with WDL root
  fallback when DTZ tables are unavailable.
- Added regression coverage for tablebase file counting, Fathom root move
  decoding, local Syzygy root probing when tables are present, root repetition
  exposure, `tb_hits`, and the MultiPV search path.

### Changed

- Changed root tablebase behavior to filter and search tablebase-correct root
  moves instead of immediately returning a single zero-node root move.
- Improved Syzygy UCI defaults and practical root tablebase usage for common
  GUI and tournament-manager setups.
- Passed repetition state into root DTZ probing so root tablebase ranking can
  account for repeated positions.
- Specialized color-specific attack lookup and reduced repeated bitboard
  queries in evaluation hot paths for a modest NPS improvement.

### Fixed

- Fixed root move restriction handling so tablebase-filtered and
  helper-thread root move lists are actually respected by the root search.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Added optional Syzygy tablebase support using the vendored Fathom probe
  library, with UCI options for path, probe depth, probe limit, and
  fifty-move-rule handling.
- Added tests for Syzygy option parsing, Fathom result decoding, disabled-path
  probing, root move conversion, and malformed path handling.

### Changed

- Improved search selectivity and speed with faster check detection, stronger
  stale-TT internal iterative reduction, deeper null-move reductions,
  check-aware pruning, and adjusted late move reductions.
- Improved tactical reliability by continuing quiescence search through check
  evasions instead of falling back to static evaluation while in check.
- Stored ProbCut lower bounds in the transposition table to improve move
  ordering and cut reuse.

### Fixed

- Reduced the risk of illegal or tactically losing search choices from
  over-pruning checking moves and check evasions.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-25

### Changed

- Removed Intel macOS release assets from the GitHub release build matrix.
  macOS release binaries are now Apple Silicon/ARM64 only.
- Clarified release asset CPU targets and local native build behavior in the
  README.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-23

Patch release focused on UCI tournament reliability.

### Fixed

- Delayed `bestmove` emission for completed `go ponder ...` searches until
  `ponderhit`, `stop`, or `quit`, matching the UCI expectation that a completed
  ponder result is retained but not reported early.
- Delayed `bestmove` emission for completed `go infinite` searches until
  `stop` or `quit`.
- Preserved the `ponder` flag when parsing combined `go ponder infinite`
  commands.
- Flushed UCI `uciok`, `readyok`, and `bestmove` replies immediately for
  pipe-based GUIs and tournament managers.

### Added

- Regression tests covering UCI ponder and infinite bestmove-release behavior.
- Search and option-parser coverage for ponderhit conversion, infinite search
  limits, and temporary limit reset behavior.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-22

Initial Lynx release.

### Implemented

- Custom Rust board representation based on bitboards, mailbox lookup, fixed
  move lists, incremental make/unmake, and Zobrist hashing.
- Complete legal move generation for standard chess, including castling,
  en passant, promotions, checks, pins, repetitions, the fifty-move rule, and
  insufficient material detection.
- Perft and board correctness test coverage for common reference positions and
  special move edge cases.
- Search benchmark support through the UCI `bench [depth]` command.
- Release benchmark and performance tests for board operations.
- `cargo bench --bench board` board implementation benchmark for cross-version
  and cross-engine comparison.
- UCI `Threads` option with Lazy SMP-style persistent-worker search and packed
  shared-transposition-table support up to 1024 threads.
- Epoch-tracked UCI command control with prioritized `quit`, asynchronous
  `stop`/`ponderhit`, serialized idle `isready` handling, and in-order EOF
  shutdown for redirected UCI sessions.
- Threaded root result selection and fixed-depth helper root diversification for
  stronger Lazy SMP behavior during both timed searches and benchmarks.
- Capture-focused qsearch with bounded check evasions and SEE-based pruning.
- Transposition table, pawn cache, correction history, main history, capture
  history, continuation history, killers, and countermoves.
- Advanced search features: PVS, aspiration windows, null-move pruning,
  ProbCut, singular extensions, futility pruning, late move pruning, late move
  reductions, SEE move ordering/pruning, and quiescence search.
- Handcrafted tapered evaluation with material, PeSTO-style piece-square tables,
  pawn structure, passed pawns, mobility, rook activity, outposts, threats,
  king safety, draw scaling, and winning-king push.
- Release profile tuning with fat LTO, one codegen unit, and `panic = "abort"`.

### Completed

- Implemented all board, search, and evaluation logic inside the engine without
  external chess crates.
- Reworked UCI engine configuration around the custom board and searcher.
- Updated the built-in `bench` command to use the current UCI options,
  including `Threads`.
- Hardened transposition-table resizing so failed large `Hash` allocations keep
  the current table instead of leaving search without TT storage.
- Hardened the shared transposition table with full-key validation to avoid
  cross-thread partial-key collisions.
- Updated qsearch to avoid full legal move regeneration outside check and to
  reuse transposition-table results in tactical leaf searches.
- Made `ponderhit` reset the active search clock after ponder search converts
  to normal thinking.
- Made helper-thread creation fail gracefully if the OS cannot create every
  requested worker.
- Kept UCI node-limited searches on the main search path to preserve the
  requested node limit when `Threads` is greater than one.
- Rebranded the package, binary, UCI identification, release workflow, and
  documentation for Lynx.
- Set the initial Lynx release version to `1.0.0`.
- Configured GitHub release assets to publish portable x86-64 and ARM64 builds,
  plus optimized AVX2 and AVX-512 builds where supported.
- Expanded documentation for UCI support, benchmarking, testing, and engine
  internals.
